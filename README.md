Code for PhD Project of **Rachel Hutchinson**

This repository contains all the code produced and/or utilised throughout Rachel Hutchinson's PhD project at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/): **Characterisation of the porcine pathogen *Trypanosoma suis***, supervised by [Professor Wendy Gibson](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/biology/people/person/LvUTQsj6YL3rfcu9jvu23JADF98Dsa).

This PhD project was a [**South West Biosciences Doctoral Training Partnership (SWBio DTP)**](https://www.swbio.ac.uk/) studentship, funded by the [**Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)**](https://bbsrc.ukri.org/).

## I am forever indebted to:
I would like to thank everyone who helped me along the way, in particular all members of the [**Bristol Trypanosome Research Group**](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/biology/research/plant/parasitology/) who witnessed and endured the perculiarities of *Trypanosoma suis* right alongside me.

### In particular: 
Wendy Gibson - I could not have hoped for a more supportive, inspiring and remarkable supervisor. 
Chris Kay - for overseeing my wobbly first steps into coding and enduring endless hours of questioning, confusion and frustration. Sir, you are a saint.
